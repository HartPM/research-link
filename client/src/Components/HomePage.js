                Research Link connects organizations with research trial participants. Organizations maintain a registry of available participants and list their trials for recruitment. Volunteers sign up and enter their demographic information to join the registry. Research Link aids in the recruitment and enrollment processes by tracking participants who have completed study surveys and those who have enrolled in trials.
